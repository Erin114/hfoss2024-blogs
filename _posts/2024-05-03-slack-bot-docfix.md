For my contribution, I chose to contribute to the CHAOSS slack bot. The slack bot is built using bolt for javascript. The current main goal for this particular project is to make it easier for beginners to contribute. 
I mainly did fixes to the main SETUP.md file and contributed ideas for the wiki. 

## Introduction to Issue 
Back when I was trying to make a contribution for my bug fix, I contacted CHAOSS both on slack and through their github to attempt to find an issue. I originally commented under issue [number 98](https://github.com/chaoss/chaoss-slack-bot/issues/98). I got a reply after after I completed my bug fix for a seperate project.

The new issue consisted of adding a missing step within the setup doc. This is [issue 101](https://github.com/chaoss/chaoss-slack-bot/issues/101)

## Solving the Issue

While trying to fix the issue, one of the main contributors closed the issue. I immediately double checked if the issue was fixed, and immediately messaged the main contributor to reopen the issue.

After resolving this small hurdle, I was officially assigned the issue and started to go down the set up steps to see if anything was missing. While adding the step was an easy fix, I did end up finding other small issues
with the doc. For example, one of the scopes were in the wrong categories or missing in the wiki, leading to some confusion setting up the basic configurations.
